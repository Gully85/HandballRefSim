Idea: Build a tool to practice handball refereeing.

simplest Question mode: Read out official rule questions, offer answer options, check against correct and give feedback
better-level Question mode: Show an animation of a situation described in an official rule question. Offer answers etc

Full-Match mode: Show an animation of an ongoing match. Pause it occasionally and ask for the rule-conformous ref decision
harder: You control the referee with WASD and viewing-direction with the mouse. Only things in the viewing cone are displayed
