Idea: Build a tool to practice handball refereeing.

simplest Question mode: Read out official rule questions, offer answer options, check against correct and give feedback
better-level Question mode: Show an animation of a situation described in an official rule question. Offer answers etc

Full-Match mode: Show an animation of an ongoing match. Pause it occasionally and ask for the rule-conformous ref decision
harder: You control the referee with WASD and viewing-direction with the mouse. Only things in the viewing cone are displayed



First, just make it a console-app. Read questions from a file (localization, start with German only), print question and possible answers,
read answers from user. At the end, summarize how many question were answered 100% correctly, and maybe more details

Architecture thoughts: 
Questions are stored in localization textfiles. questions-german.txt. Format is CSV. First line depicts columns. 



















Less important stuff:
Found a typo in the official rule question (german). Question 1.12 c and d, it says "Spielfeldfeld"
